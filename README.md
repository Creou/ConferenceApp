## Conference App ##

This app was created as a technical experimentation project to give us something to build while learning Angular.JS and Xamarin.

The idea is to be a companion app for a conference attendee. Features:

- View sessions by track
- View sessions by time
- Provide feedback on sessions
- Provide overall event feedback

The current app is branded with the DDD-EA logos and sessions from last year, but the goal is that the app can be whitelabeled to work for any conference.
